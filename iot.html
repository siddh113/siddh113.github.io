                                <p>To meet the requirements of our home automation system, we proposed the following system design using Python and ada Fruit:</p>
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li><b>System architecture:</b>Our home automation system follows a distributed architecture to ensure seamless communication and efficient data flow between different system components. The architecture consists of three main components: sensor nodes, a gateway node, and the user interface.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Sensor nodes: </strong> The system incorporates at least three sensor nodes strategically placed within the home to collect data on temperature, humidity, light intensity, and motion. Each sensor node is equipped with appropriate sensors and communicates with the gateway node to transmit collected data.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Gateway nodes:</strong>The central gateway node serves as the brain of the system. It receives data from the sensor nodes, processes the data, and communicates with actuators and the user interface. The gateway node ensures efficient data exchange, performs data analysis, and issues instructions to actuators based on predefined rules and user preferences.</li>
                                        <li><strong>User interface: </strong>The user interface, developed using the Qada Fruit library, provides homeowners with a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard to monitor and control various aspects of their home environment. It displays real-time data from the sensor nodes, provides control options for the actuators, and allows users to set preferences and schedules for automated tasks.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li><b>IOT protocols and technologies:</b>To enable seamless communication between the sensor nodes, gateway, and user interface, the system utilizes MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) or CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) as the communication protocols. MQTT ensures efficient data transmission with minimal bandwidth and power consumption, while CoAP provides a lightweight protocol suitable for resource-constrained devices.</li>
